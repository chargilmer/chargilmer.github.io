A pure CSS sprite animation switcher that allows selecting different character actions using radio buttons. The default animation is an idle pose, and additional animations like jump, fly, punch, and death can be selected. Each animation is triggered by switching the corresponding sprite sheet using CSS variables. Once selected, the chosen animation plays in a loop at a configurable frame rate, also controlled via CSS. No JavaScript is used â€” everything is handled through modern CSS features.
